## Special Handling Instructions

### Error Handling

If the AI returns incomplete or malformed JSON:
1. Retry with a more explicit instruction about JSON format
2. If still failing, process the text response to extract useful information
3. Default to a fallback recommendation if processing fails completely

### Token Management

For longer resumes or job descriptions:
1. Use the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model for initial parsing
2. Summarize content before sending for detailed analysis
3. Process in sections if total tokens exceed limits

### Response Validation Rules

1. Verify all required fields are present in the response
2. Check for realistic scoring (0-100 range)
3. Ensure suggestion texts are different from originals
4. Validate that all referenced resume sections actually exist
5. Check that recommendations are specific, not generic
